# OCaml Wake-On-LAN

OCaml implementation of Wake-On-LAN (WOL). Comes with a CLI to send WOL packets and check if we can connect on the standard SSH port (22).

We also provide a library if you want to embed functionality in your own application.

## TODO

- [ ] Consider splitting out Eio parts to separate library
- [ ] Move unix stuff to separate library
- [ ] Expose more options in CLI
